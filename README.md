# TimeCapsuleLLM
An LLM trained only on data from certain time periods to reduce modern bias

Imagine if an AI model didnt just pretend to be historical but actually was.

Built on nanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy.

# Project Goals 
The goal of this project is to test if we can train a small LLM from the ground up and reduce modern bias to 0. 

TimeCapsule LLM is an expirimental project that will only be trained on texts written during certain time periods. The goal is to simulate the worldview and language of specific historical eras.

# Why fine tuning is nt enough 

Of course achieving zero modern bias is very difficult but I want to get as close as possible to this.

I cannot simply fine tune a model, because it already knows modern things and I would just be painting over modern bias not erasing it.

# Expected outcomes (hopefully)

So my goal is to train a model from scratch using only text from a certain time period, these texts will be free of modern interpretaion, translation, modern annotations, etc.

Hopefully when finished, this model will not know modern concepts and will not be able to reason beyond what it's been trained on.

# Update July 9th 2025

I've set my time period for 1800-1850 and region: London 

I've gathered a list of texts, books, documents 

So far I've gotten 50 as txt files and will begin training NanoGPT soon 

Will update this as long as progress is made

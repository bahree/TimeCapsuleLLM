# TimeLockLLM
An LLM trained only on data from certain time periods to reduce modern bias

Imagine if an AI model didnt just pretend to be historical but actually was.

The goal of this project is to test if we can train a small LLM from the ground up and reduce modern bias to 0. 

TimeLock LLM is an expirimental project that will only be trained on texts written during certain time periods. The goal is to simulate the worldview and language of specific historical eras.
